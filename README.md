## Exercise #1

1. 1. The program exsits as the file "generate_subgraphs.py", to run it, make sure you install all the dependencies from the requirements file and then run the command `python generate_subgraphs.py {n}`, the program prints to stdout by default, you can change that by redirecting the output to a file in the command line by adding `> {filename}` to the command.
    2. The output of the code on the inputs 1-4 are in the files called n.txt respectively.
    3. The maximal input n for which the code runs in under 1 hour is n=4
    4. Estimations show that n=5 will finish in under 2 hours, extrapolating from the fact that n=4 took under 2 seconds that will mean that n=6 will not complete under 8 hours.
2. AAAAAAAAAAA
